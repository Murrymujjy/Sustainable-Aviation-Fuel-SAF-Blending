**Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Blending: A Predictive Modeling Approach**

**Overview**

This project focuses on developing machine learning models to predict the properties of complex fuel blends. The work was completed as a submission for a major hackathon centered on sustainable energy. The primary goal was to create a predictive tool that can guide the formulation of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs), helping to accelerate the aviation industry's transition to a net-zero future without compromising on safety or performance.

**Problem Statement:**

The relationships between fuel components and their final blend properties are highly complex, involving linear and non-linear interactions. This high-dimensional problem requires sophisticated predictive models to accurately forecast key properties of new fuel blends. The challenge was to build a model capable of:

Rapidly evaluating thousands of potential blend combinations.

Identifying optimal recipes that maximize sustainability while meeting rigorous specifications.

Reducing the development time for new sustainable fuel formulations.

**Key Achievements**

Advanced Modeling: I built and evaluated over 100 machine learning models, including ensemble methods and advanced deep learning architectures (transformers), to capture the intricate relationships within the data.

**High Performance:** Achieved a top accuracy score of 80.5909 using lightBM and catboost.

**Competitive Ranking:** Placed at 359th position among over 7,000 participants.

**Technical Approach**
The solution was built using Python. The workflow included several key stages:

**Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, scaled features, and engineered new variables to optimize model performance.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed the relationships between different fuel components and their impact on final properties using visualizations and statistical methods.

**Model Building:** Experimented with a wide range of models, from classic machine learning algorithms to complex deep neural networks. The best-performing models were often ensemble methods that combined the power of several different algorithms.

**Evaluation:** Used metrics like accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate model performance and fine-tune hyperparameters.
